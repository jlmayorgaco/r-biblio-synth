I. INTRODUCTION
Paragraph 1: Background & Context

Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have become a key technology in real-time signal processing and control applications due to their ability to perform highly parallel computations with low latency. Unlike traditional microcontrollers or digital signal processors (DSPs), FPGAs provide a reconfigurable hardware platform that can be tailored for specific tasks, making them particularly useful in power systems, robotics, and embedded control. In particular, FPGA-based implementations of Kalman filters have gained attention in applications requiring high-speed estimation, such as power system frequency estimation, autonomous navigation, and adaptive control. Despite their advantages, designing efficient FPGA-based Kalman filters presents challenges in terms of hardware resource utilization, numerical stability, and real-time computation constraints.
Paragraph 2: Why Bibliometric Analysis is Important?

Bibliometric analysis provides a systematic approach to quantify and map the evolution of research fields by analyzing publication trends, citation networks, and key contributors. In recent years, FPGAs have been increasingly adopted for signal processing and estimation algorithms, yet no comprehensive bibliometric study has assessed the landscape of FPGA-based Kalman filter research. Understanding the evolution of this research field can help identify emerging trends, research gaps, and key technological advancements, enabling researchers and engineers to make informed decisions about future developments.
Paragraph 3: Research Gap

Although several studies have reviewed Kalman filter implementations in software and hardware, there is a lack of systematic analysis of FPGA-based implementations. Previous reviews have focused on algorithmic improvements, numerical stability, and precision trade-offs, but few have examined how research in this area has evolved over time, who the leading contributors are, and what challenges remain unaddressed. This paper aims to fill this gap by conducting a bibliometric study of FPGA-based Kalman filter research, identifying key publication trends, research collaborations, and technological shifts.
Paragraph 4: Research Objectives & Questions

The objective of this study is to analyze the bibliometric landscape of FPGA-based Kalman filter research, providing insights into its growth, key contributors, and emerging research directions. Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions:

    RQ1: How has research on FPGA-based Kalman filters evolved over the last two decades?
    RQ2: Who are the leading authors, institutions, and countries contributing to this field?
    RQ3: What are the most influential papers and journals in FPGA-based Kalman filter research?
    RQ4: What are the main thematic clusters and emerging trends in FPGA implementations of Kalman filters?

Paragraph 5: Methodological Overview

To address these questions, we conduct a bibliometric analysis using Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), analyzing publications from the last 20 years. The study employs Bibliometrix in R and VOSviewer to extract publication trends, co-citation networks, keyword co-occurrence patterns, and collaboration structures. The dataset includes research articles, conference papers, and review studies related to FPGA-based implementations of Kalman filters and related estimation techniques.
